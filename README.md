# bookmarks-search

Websites like Rotten Tomatoes & Metacritic are well-known as up-to-date, easily-searchable aggregates for critic opinions on films, TV shows, video games, and other media. However, the same has not historically existed for book reviews. To rectify this absence, the website Book Marks was launched by Literary Hub in 2016, providing an aggregate of book reviews for inquisitive readers. Book Marks remains somewhat limited in its search capacities, nonetheless - its archives are unsearchable by publication date, overall score, or genre, and data is sparse for books released before 2016.

The tool below uses Scrapy to scrape statistics from Book Marks, compile them in a MySQL database, and display that data in a website created with Angular.

The GIFs Demonstration.gif and WebsiteDemonstration.gif provide examples of how to scrape the data from Book Marks to a MySQL database and the website.
